# Accessibility-Standards 

https://pvmend.github.io/accessibility-standards/

## Description

I needed to refactor some of the HTML to be more accessible so that the site is optimized for search engines. 
 By adding semantic coding I help meet accessibility standards.
 I learned about semnatic coding and calling classes and ids in HTML and CSS. 


## Installation

For installation I created a Github pages https:// page.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
